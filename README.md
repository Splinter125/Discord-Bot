# Discord-Bot

Here you can find the syntax for a Discord web-hook: https://birdie0.github.io/discord-webhooks-guide/discord_webhook.html
  
The idea is to build two webhooks: one for TikTok and one for Instagram

The webhooks will be "managed" by a Discord bot which will also be able to post Twitter posts
